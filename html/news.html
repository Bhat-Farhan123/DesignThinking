          <p class="news-card-text" data-full-text="Shoolini University has achieved a landmark accomplishment by securing an A+ grade from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with an impressive Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 3.33 on a 4-point scale. This milestone places the university among India's top educational institutions, highlighting its focus on delivering exceptional education and promoting innovation. 

          The NAAC accreditation process evaluates institutions across seven rigorous criteria, with Shoolini University excelling in four key areas: Curricular Aspects, Infrastructure and Learning Resources, Governance and Leadership, and Institutional Values and Best Practices. 
          
          Founder-Chancellor Prof PK Khosla said the achievement reflected the hard work of the entire university community. 'This recognition reflects the dedication, passion, and excellence of our Shoolini family, who consistently strive for higher standards. My heartfelt congratulations to our students, staff, and faculty,' he said. 
          
          Pro-Chancellor Vishal Anand emphasised that the A+ accreditation is a significant milestone in the university’s journey toward global recognition. 'This validation of our efforts in quality education, research, and innovation brings us closer to our vision of establishing Shoolini University as one of the Top 100 Global Universities, ' he said. 
          
          Vice Chancellor Prof Atul Khosla thanked the faculty, staff, and students for their contributions. He remarked, 'This accomplishment highlights our commitment to providing world-class education and driving advancements in research. It demonstrates our dedication to creating a learning environment that equips students to excel in today’s competitive world.' 
          
          The rigorous NAAC evaluation is recognised as a benchmark of quality in higher education. Institutions are graded based on their performance in key areas, and the CGPA is derived from an assessment of all seven criteria. 
          
          Leading the accreditation efforts was Varsha Patil, Director of Rankings and Accreditations and Coordinator of the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC). Reflecting on the achievement, she said, 'This milestone is the result of the collective hard work of our entire team.

          <p class="news-card-text" data-full-text="Shoolini University has strengthened its position as a top academic institution in the QS World University Rankings, Asia 2025, advancing to 168th from 213th in Asia. Nationally, the university has risen to 14th among Indian universities, up from 21st, and is now ranked 4th among private universities. 

          The university excelled in the categories of Citations per Paper and International Faculty, ranking first among all Indian institutions. This accomplishment reflects Shoolini's dedication to impactful research and global academic collaborations, setting a benchmark in higher education. 
          
          Shoolini University’s h-index of 137 reflects a significant research impact, indicating that at least 137 of its research papers have been cited 137 times or more. This metric, influenced by the university's age and academic output, is derived using Scopus indicators. Scopus is one of the most esteemed abstract and citation databases for academic research, and the h-index serves as a measure of research quality, linking the number of papers to their citation frequency. 
          
          Celebrating the achievements, Founder-Chancellor Prof PK Khosla said, “Our progress in the QS Asia Rankings shows our commitment to building a world-class academic environment. These successes drive our passion for research excellence and inspire us to keep moving forward.” He noted that the recognition will further enhance Shoolini’s global impact.

Their commitment has solidified our reputation as one of the top private universities in India,” he remarked. “We remain driven to provide an education that meets international standards and encourages innovation.” 
          
          Vice Chancellor Prof Atul Khosla highlighted the research-focused culture at Shoolini. “Achieving top spots in citations and international faculty diversity emphasises our growing influence in academia and industry,” he said. “These results come from our investment in research and our focus on building a vibrant, diverse academic community.”

            Researchers Develop Herbal Spray to...
          </h3>
          <p class="news-card-text" data-full-text="Researchers at Shoolini University have developed an innovative herbal spray to prevent excessive blood loss from injuries. The invention, led by Professor Deepak Kumar from the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Shoolini University, in collaboration with Rajeswar Kamal Kant Arya of Kumaun University, focuses on harnessing the natural healing and blood-coagulating properties of the Eupatorium adenophorum plant. 

          When applied directly to a wound, the spray forms a protective film, offering a unique approach to wound care. Unlike synthetic products currently on the market that use chemicals like lidocaine and benzethonium chloride, this spray uses natural ingredients, making it a safer alternative. Synthetic sprays often contain chemicals that can lead to skin irritation and long-term side effects such as dermatitis. In contrast, this herbal spray avoids these risks by leveraging the natural properties of Eupatorium adenophorum for blood coagulation and wound healing. 
          
          “We wanted to create something that bridges nature and science, offering a safe and effective solution for wound care,” said Professor Deepak Kumar. “This herbal spray taps into the natural healing power of Eupatorium adenophorum to prevent blood loss quickly, making it accessible for everyone, from hospitals to people in remote areas. Our goal is to make a real difference in emergency care by providing a product that’s gentle on the skin and kind to the environment.” 
          
          The research team meticulously crafted the formulation using ethyl cellulose as a film-forming agent and polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) as a plasticiser, both recognised for their safety and effectiveness. This selection of ingredients ensures that the spray forms a thin, transparent, and smooth layer over the wound, which can instantly stop blood flow while protecting the injury from infections. 
          
          The researchers followed a detailed extraction process, collecting Eupatorium adenophorum leaves from Bhimtal in Uttarakhand. Ethanol extraction helped isolate the active compounds responsible for blood coagulation and wound healing. The spray formulation underwent numerous trials to determine the optimal quantities of polymer, plasticiser, and solvent. 
          
          A major advantage of this spray is its eco-friendly, non-toxic nature. Unlike synthetic sprays that use flammable or environmentally harmful propellants, this herbal formulation is safe and cost-effective. Its low production cost makes it possible to use it on a large scale in various settings, from hospitals and clinics to first-aid kits and outdoor survival gear. 
          
          With its rapid blood-clotting action and wound-healing properties, this spray is expected to transform first-aid and emergency medical care, particularly in regions where healthcare facilities are limited or far. Its portability and ease of use offer a practical solution for controlling blood loss in accidents, outdoor activities, and even military operations. This Shoolini invention is a significant step in advancing healthcare research. ">

          <p class="news-card-text" data-full-text="'One afternoon, during a session, we heard our short film had won a national award. It took a moment to sink in… then the room filled with resounding applause… the intense effort we put into filming, interviewing, and editing had paid off!'   A Pawan Kalyan, a semester 5 BAJMC student from the School of Media and Communications, couldn't contain his excitement as he recalled the joyful day. 

          The final-year BAJMC students won a national award for their short film, 'Samej Se Sabak'  on disaster management, along with a cash prize of ₹1 lakh. The national award was presented by Union Tourism Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. 
          
          The award ceremony was held on October 23, 2024, at Dr Ambedkar International Centre in New Delhi, marking the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction. Director, School of Media and Communications, Prof Vipin Pubby, and Asst Prof Paarth Sharma received the award on behalf of the students. 
          
          The short film secured third place in the national competition organised by the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM). 
          
          The idea for the film took root when Asst Prof Paarth Sharma discovered the NIDM short film contest. Asst Prof Sharma is also the director of the film. Despite the upcoming Term 1 exam, he saw a dual opportunity: final-year students could create a short film for the competition, which would also count as their exam. 
          
          Special classes were held to brainstorm and discuss the project. A young team of filmmakers, including Aryan Thakur, Swarnim Suprakash, Antrisha Chauhan, Vanshika Thakur, Archan Sharma, Sakshi Kumari, Kunal, Kavya Choudhary, Niraj Sharma, Apurva, Misal, Adarsh Ghasta, Kashish Chandel, Anshul, Pawan Kalyan, and Sahil, worked together. 
          
          The students were divided into groups and assigned different locations to interview people who could provide insights into flood preparedness. Their journey began with researching the area in Himachal Pradesh most affected by floods. 
          
          One of the most impacted villages was Samej in Himachal Pradesh, which had suffered a cloudburst just weeks before they started filming. The devastation was unimaginable, and the fear among the people was heart-wrenching. 
          
          In Samej, the students interviewed two victims and a hydropower plant worker who had seen the disaster's effects first-hand. The award-winning film also includes an interview with Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, gaining insight into the government's response to such crises. 
          
          They also interviewed Assistant Commandant Karam Singh from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), who was on duty in Samej during the cloudburst, and Asst Prof Kanupriya, who teaches Geology at Solan Degree College. 
          
          'We didn't create this documentary to win; rather, we wanted to raise awareness. We also wanted to shed light on this remote village Samej and the resilience of its people,'  said Niraj Sharma, one of the students involved in the documentary.
          
          Top universities like Mizoram University and SRM University (Andhra Pradesh) were also among the competitors. This accomplishment is a proud moment for Shoolini University Chancellor Prof PK Khosla, Pro Chancellor Vishal Anand, and Vice Chancellor Prof Atul Khosla, who appreciated the students for their outstanding achievements. Winning this national award brings pride to the university and sets a strong example for future students.">

Recently, Assistant Prof Ekta Singh from the Chitrakoot School of Liberal Arts and Assistant Prof Radha from the Faculty of Sciences received global acclaim for their research achievements. Their contributions have brought international attention to Shoolini, showcasing the university’s academic excellence and inspiring students. 

          Assistant Prof Ekta Singh from the Chitrakoot School of Liberal Arts published her research article in the prestigious UNESCO proceedings titled ‘Preparing for the Next Pandemic: Leveraging Social and Human Sciences for Crisis—Lessons from COVID-19’.  
          
          Her paper, ‘The Impact of Push-Pull Factors on the Socio-Economic Status of Migrant Workers in the Neoliberal World Economy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of District Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India’, discusses the challenges migrant workers faced during the pandemic. 
          
          Her research explores how economic challenges and limited job opportunities in rural areas force people to migrate to cities. It also examines reverse migration during the pandemic and its impact on the socio-economic conditions of workers. 
          
          Asst Prof Ekta Singh collected the primary and secondary data from Pauri Garhwal District for her research. She conducted field surveys and interviews with migrants who returned during the first wave of COVID-19 and used statistical methods to analyse their challenges. Her work highlights important patterns in migration. 
          
          “This pandemic showed how vulnerable migrant workers are in a neoliberal economy,” Asst Prof Ekta Singh said. “We need policies focusing on human dignity rather than just market-driven solutions. I hope my research inspires future scholars to work towards creating more inclusive and resilient societies.” 
          
          This research offers valuable lessons for students. It encourages them to think about how future policies can better address migration challenges while helping them develop the skills to tackle real-world problems. 
          
          Meanwhile, Assistant Prof Radha from the Faculty of Sciences represented Shoolini University at the World Cotton Research Conference-8 (WCRC-8) in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

          In addition to her academic work, she participated in two competitions and won first place in both. She won first prize in a craft-making competition using cotton and in a traditional dress competition, where she represented Himachal Pradesh in a pure cotton Himachali outfit. She received $200 for her traditional dress and $100 for her craft, which she completed in just 10 minutes.
          
          “As a researcher, it was an incredible experience to present my work on an international platform and to represent both Shoolini University and the cultural heritage of Himachal Pradesh. I’ve gained valuable insights and global perspectives to enhance my teaching and research,” says Asst Prof Radha. 
          
          Her participation at WCRC-8 highlighted her academic skills and celebrated the cultural richness of Himachal Pradesh on an international stage.

          <p class="news-card-text" data-full-text="Ever thought of managing your health with just a few taps on your phone? No clinic visits, no long waits, and medicines delivered straight to your door. Shoolini University researchers have made this a reality with their cutting-edge telemedicine device. Designed to bring quality healthcare to even the most remote areas, this portable gadget lets users track their health in real-time, consult with doctors virtually, and even earn cryptocurrency rewards for staying healthy.  

          Recently patented, the device tracks key health metrics such as blood pressure, blood sugar, and mental well-being through sensors connected to smartphones and wearables like smartwatches. It doesn't stop there — after gathering data, the system asks targeted questions and performs real-time analysis using FP-Growth and association rules to assess the patient's health and provide personalised recommendations. It can also detect early symptoms of diseases like diabetes, alerting both the patient and their doctor.  
          
          “The ability to detect early symptoms is crucial,” says Anitya Kumar Gupta, Ramanujan Research Associate and PhD scholar at Shoolini University. “Our device can make a significant difference in preventive healthcare.” 
          
          One of the most innovative features is the use of cryptocurrency incentives. Patients can earn Dogecoins to achieve health goals, such as meeting step targets or staying hydrated. “We wanted to create a system that motivates people to take control of their health in a fun and rewarding way,” Gupta adds. 
          
          This groundbreaking device was developed by Gupta in collaboration with SRP students Aditi Kulshreshtha and Sataditya Jana from the School of Biotechnology at Shoolini University. It has already attracted attention from both medical and tech experts.  
          
          Gupta's work has also led to a partnership with Claremont Graduate University in the USA, where he is collaborating with Samir Chatterjee, Fletcher Jones Chair of Technology Design & Management at the Center for Information Systems and Technology. Together, they are working to further develop the system, with Dogecoin as the primary cryptocurrency.  
          
          “Our partnership with Claremont has opened new avenues for innovation,” says Gupta. “The integration of Dogecoin as a reward system makes healthcare management more engaging for users.”  
          
          The device integrates smoothly with popular mobile apps like Apple's Health app, meaning there’s no need for a separate telemedicine platform. It continuously monitors symptoms, provides instant feedback, and promotes proactive healthcare. Patients can schedule virtual appointments and receive care from home, while prescriptions are fulfilled and delivered by local pharmacies through a built-in system. 
          
          “My deepest gratitude goes to Chancellor Prof PK Khosla, Pro-Chancellor Vishal Anand, and Vice Chancellor Prof Atul Khosla for their invaluable guidance,” Gupta shares. “Their support helped us navigate the complexities of patent development and find the right collaborations.” 
          
          The student researchers involved in the invention were equally enthusiastic about their experience. “Our patent is an example of the incredible research opportunities here at Shoolini,” says SRP student Sataditya Jana.  
          
          Aditi Kulshreshtha, another SRP student, shares her journey: “I began my medical studies in Ukraine but had to return to India due to the ongoing war. That unexpected turn led me to Shoolini, where I found a new path in research. This project has truly been transformative.” 
          
          Looking ahead, Gupta and his team are developing a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically send prescriptions to local pharmacies, ensuring medications get delivered without the patient needing to leave home. Although the device is still in the feedback stage, they plan to introduce a three-tier subscription model. 
          
          The team’s innovation marks a significant step toward the future of healthcare, blending technology, convenience, and incentives to empower individuals to take charge of their well-being.

She began with an engaging exercise, asking the audience to close their eyes and envision typical archetypes such as a hero, a princess, a warrior, and a leader. The exercise revealed that these archetypes often carried a male lens.
          
          In her valedictory note, Shoolini University Centre for Leadership Coaching Deputy Director and Head Payal Khanna emphasised that the project was entirely pro bono, stating, “The foundation laid here at the Center for Leadership Coaching will serve generations to come.”">

            Shoolini Students Debut Docu Creations
          </h3>
          <p class="news-card-text" data-full-text="When the lights dim and the camera rolls, a world of imagination comes alive. Talented Shoolini students have created such a world with their documentaries. Titled ‘Dance of Gods: Mandi Shivratri’ and ‘Himachal’s Traditional Game: Thoda’, the films are a window into the culture and traditions of Himachal Pradesh. Let’s take a peek behind the scenes to discover how these budding filmmakers brought their vision to the screen with flair and originality. 

          Produced by Shoolini filmmaking club, Cinedicate, the ‘Dance of Gods’, was a hit with audiences for showcasing the grandeur of Maha Shivratri festival in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. The documentary, funded and conceptualised by Shoolini University Chief Learning Officer Dr Ashoo Khosla, offers an immersive look into the cultural and spiritual essence of the festival. 
          
          Production for the film began in December when five students set off to Mandi on a research trip to explore the local traditions. They were supported by two key figures: Birbal Sharma, an award-winning photographer renowned for capturing the region’s cultural heritage, and Maan Singh Thakur, the caretaker of the Mandi King’s Palace (now the Raj Mahal Hotel). Thakur's assistance was crucial, helping the team access restricted areas during the festival. This not only deepened their research but also enabled them to create a compelling documentary film. 
          
          Despite several challenges—particularly resistance from festival attendees who were uncomfortable with the cameras—the team pushed through. The post-production process came with its own hurdles, as the high-quality footage was large and complex to edit. After months of hard work, ‘Dance of the Gods’ was finally completed and premiered at the university on August 30th. Viewers widely praised the film, particularly impressed by its stunning cinematography. 
          
          Reflecting on her production, Dr Ashoo Khosla shared, “I’ve dedicated this film to my grandparents and all grandparents, who are keepers of our oral traditions. Their stories keep our culture alive. This film is my tribute to Mandi, its rich traditions, and the timeless Shivratri festival. Praising the efforts of students, she said, “I’m truly impressed by their passion and hard work.'' 
          
          Meanwhile, students from the School of Media and Communications (2021-2024) at Shoolini University created a remarkable documentary on ‘Thoda’, a traditional game of Himachal Pradesh. Known for its deep-rooted respect for rituals and traditions, Himachal Pradesh treasures ‘Thoda’ for its historical significance. During their research, the students discovered that many locals were unaware of this ancient practice, making the film a crucial effort to preserve and promote the game. 
          
          The team collaborated with cultural conservationist Jiyalal Thakur, whose expertise in ‘Thoda’ brought depth to the film. They were fortunate to witness a live game in Balghar, near Oachghat, Solan, where they interviewed Yashwant Damset, a ‘Thoda’ team captain. His insights, along with contributions from Dinesh Chandel, the organiser of the village fair, helped shape the film’s narrative. 
          
          Saloni Verma, one of the journalism students involved in making the documentary, said, “I loved discovering the cultural heritage of Himachal Pradesh. This game taught me the value of discipline and respect for opponents. It’s important to show respect in all situations, no matter who you are dealing with.” 
          
          These opportunities gave students hands-on experience, boosting their confidence and inspiring them to push their boundaries. The documentaries they created reflect their hard work, creativity, and passion for telling meaningful stories.

          In an exclusive chat with Shoolini IMPACT, Mustafa shares his excitement about this incredible journey. He talks about what it means to receive the Erasmus Mundus Scholarship and how he looks forward to the enriching experience of studying in multiple countries. Read on to discover more about Mustafa’s thoughts and aspirations. 
          
          Q. 1 What inspired you to study Food Technology at Shoolini University?  
          My father is a businessman, but he never pressured me to take over his business; he always respected my interests. I chose Food Technology because it offers two exciting opportunities: ongoing research and entrepreneurship. This sector is rapidly emerging as a significant economic force. 
          
          Shoolini University stood out among the few private universities offering this course. Its serene environment provides a better atmosphere than universities in other states. Although I secured a company placement in my seventh semester, my primary goal throughout the four-year B Tech Food Tech program was to explore research and entrepreneurship to find my best path. 
          
          Q. 2 What motivated you to apply for the Erasmus Mundus Scholarship, and how did you feel when you found out you won? 
          The Erasmus Mundus Scholarship, the European Union’s most prestigious program, caught my attention even before I joined Shoolini. From the moment I learned about it, I wanted to become an Erasmus scholar. Named after the medieval European educator Erasmus of Rotterdam, this program has facilitated international research for years, and I yearned to be part of its impactful network. 
          
          While interning in Taiwan, I received an email informing me of my selection for the master’s program and the Erasmus Mundus scholarship. It felt surreal, considering the intense global competition and limited seats per country. It took me a while to believe I had been accepted. 
          
          I was thrilled to receive an invitation to meet the Belgian Ambassador to India at the Embassy of Belgium in New Delhi, dedicated to Erasmus scholars. Unfortunately, I couldn’t attend because I was already in Taiwan for an exchange program.
          
          Q. 3 What excites you most about the master’s program, and how do you feel about studying in four different countries: Belgium, Germany, Portugal, and Ireland? 
          The European Master of Science in Sustainable Food Systems Engineering, Technology, and Business aligns perfectly with my interests. It blends food science with global business perspectives. This two-year program spans four countries, with KU Leuven as the leading institution, ranked 45th in the THE World University Rankings. Its partner universities are also renowned. The program opens doors to entrepreneurship in the food sector and offers opportunities in research and policymaking, embodying a global approach. 
          
          Studying in four different countries will be both exciting and challenging. It’s an excellent opportunity to explore the world, something I’ve always wanted to do. This experience also complements my interest in creating international travel vlogs, a passion I developed during my exchange in Taiwan. 
          
          Q. 4 What are your academic and career goals, and how will this program help you achieve them? 
          This program will shape my academic and career goals by equipping me to address global food system challenges from a multidisciplinary perspective. I envision myself tackling these issues and making a substantial impact through research, reflecting my ambition to pursue a PhD. Alternatively, I can apply my expertise in roles within global food companies or government organisations. Whichever path I choose, I am confident this program will enable me to achieve my objectives effectively.
          
          Q. 5 How will you contribute towards sustainable food systems? 
          I plan to focus my research on reducing the use of food additives, which have potential adverse health effects. Also, I am passionate about tackling global food waste and minimising the carbon footprint of food production. I hope to create more sustainable food systems by addressing these critical issues.  
          
          Q. 6 What challenges did you face during the application process, and how did you overcome them?   
          The application process was complex. Distinguishing my profile required learning to impress academic committees and highlight my achievements. I invested a lot of time in seeking advice from successful students admitted to top universities. 
          
          Securing strong letters of recommendation was also challenging. However, I obtained endorsements from distinguished individuals: Dr Swarup, my former research supervisor and one of the world’s top 2% scientists recognised by Stanford; Prof Dinesh Kumar, Head of the School of Bioengineering and Food Technology; Prof Pankaj Chauhan; and Komal Khosla, CEO of Carra Chocolates, where I completed my internship. 
          
          Q. 7 How has Shoolini University prepared you for this international program, and who has been your biggest support? 
          Shoolini University has friendly professors who are always ready to help students achieve their goals. Prof Dinesh Kumar is known for his kindness and support. The advanced labs, including the Central Instrumentation Facility, support research across departments. Commercial labs on campus offer additional services. The university provides a supportive environment, encouraging students to take initiative proactively. The green, picturesque campus has always uplifted my spirits. 
          
          My strongest supporters have been my parents. My father believed in my abilities, and my mother, an arts graduate, nurtured my learning. At Shoolini, Swarup Roy, a former assistant professor in the Faculty of Applied Sciences and Biotechnology, was my greatest advocate. Under his guidance, I authored and published a research paper, a patent, and a review paper in respected Scopus journals, with several more publications under review. These achievements helped me secure the Erasmus Mundus Scholarship. 
          
          Q. 8 What’s your advice for students who want to win prestigious international scholarships to study abroad? 
          Setting a clear goal and focusing on specific study areas is essential. To boost my profile, I added business management and entrepreneurship courses, aligning with program requirements. Starting research in my second year, I learned the importance of early commitment and choosing the right advisor. 
          
          Writing strong Statements of Purpose (SOPs) and building my profile with publications, patents, internships, and extracurricular activities were also crucial. Balancing academics with diverse interests and social activities is important to ensure a well-rounded experience.
          
          Q. 9 After completing your master’s program, do you plan on returning to India or working internationally? 
          After completing my master’s program, I plan to work internationally to make a global impact. However, I am keen to apply the expertise I gain abroad to address critical issues in India’s food sector, such as unregulated foods, non-compliance with standards, harmful chemicals, and overall food hygiene and safety. Ultimately, using my global knowledge to improve these standards in India would be very fulfilling. 
          
          Q. 10 What are your top tips for Shoolini students? 
          My time at Shoolini was peaceful and fulfilling, though it passed quickly. To juniors, I’d stress that opportunities are plentiful if you seize them. Focus on using the resources and exploring scholarship programs and application processes independently online. Don’t hesitate to seek guidance from professors and your university. Building a strong profile requires time and continuous effort. While a couple of internships are beneficial, diversifying your experiences can boost your confidence. Additionally, engaging in research will improve your career prospects significantly.">
